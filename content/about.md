title: About me
---

Hey, I'm Alex (he/him). I'm a software developer based in Bonn, Germany. I spend my days writing code, and somehow I still enjoy doing it in my free time too.

Outside of coding, you'll find me going for walks or a hike. I also like to put on some music and just exist for a while.

## Things I like

Here's an incomplete list of things I'm interested in or want to learn more about:

- Nix/NixOS
- self-hosting
- OpenStreetMap
- indieweb
- free software
- functional programming
- rust/haskell/go/zig
- emacs (and org-mode, my beloved)
- bsd (never used, but want to try it out sometime)
- unix history
