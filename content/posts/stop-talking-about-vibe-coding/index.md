Everyone is talking about vibe coding. It seems impossible to pass a day without reading or hearing about it. But why? I mean, everyone knows that it is a shitty VC funded AI buzzword-bingo idea that's just a rage bait[^fn:1] (and I'm falling victim to the rage bait). Nothing more. Nobody will seriously vibe code. Because if you don't understand the code, you lack the understanding to maintain it. You depend on an AI for maintaining the code and fixing bugs, but the AI will probably perform worse as the projects grow. Therefore, increasing the challenge in maintainability.

Vibe coding will stop you from learning to code and just increase your reliance on AI. Therefore, you now **need** an AI to code, cannot just stop using it, because you don't understand the code. You are not a developer anymore but a customer to an AI company. Needing AI to do what you do, like an addiction. You cannot get off of it, because then you would need to learn how to code. But the AI made you dumber, problem-solving skills and critical thinking decline when using AI frequently[^fn:2].
